## âœ¨ Overview

**GZAssist** is a personal-use desktop assistant for Windows that captures the visible screen and sends it directly to OpenAI's Vision API to summarize, translate, or explain its contents â€” all within a floating overlay that keeps your workflow uninterrupted.

Perfect for developers, readers, and learners who need quick insights from whatâ€™s on their screen.

> ðŸ”„ Local OCR is not currently used â€” all visual understanding is handled by the AI itself.

---

## âœ… Current Features

- Global hotkey activation (Ctrl + Alt + K)
- Fullscreen or active window screenshot
- OpenAI GPT Vision integration (supports GPT-4o)
- Clean and minimal overlay with answer
- No need to switch tabs or copy/paste
